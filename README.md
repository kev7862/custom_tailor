# Description.
Bespoke Suits seeks to revolutionize the fashion industry by connecting tailors and the corporate sector. Research has proved that there are a lot of skilled tailors all over Nairobi with no platform to showcase their work, so we act as a stepping stone. We plan to do this by showcasing already made different designs made by our tailor at very affordable prices, and also giving our clients an opportunity to create their own designs and having them delivered at the comfort of their work place.
